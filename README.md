# BoB_Magnetometer_Contours

A shiny app for working with magnetometer data, with preference to Marine Magnetics BoB. This can take the raw csv files, interpolate them, generate contours and convert it all into spatial information. Output can be previewed in a leaflet map, and exported to spatial formats. 

Written while employed at the Western Australian Museum, 2021.
