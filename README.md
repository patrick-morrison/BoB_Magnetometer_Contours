# BoB_Magnetometer_Contours

An shiny app for working with magnetometer data, with preference to Marine Magnetics BoB. This can take the raw csv files, interpolate them, and convert them into spatial information. Output can be previewed in leaflet prior to export.

Written while employed at the Western Australian Museum, 2021.
